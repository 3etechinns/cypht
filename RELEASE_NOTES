Cypht version 1.1.0

This is the second stable Cypht release. It's been over a year and a half
since our last stable release. A few new features have been added, testing
has been VASTLY improved, and many many bugs have been fixed. Thanks to
everyone who has generously contributed time to the project from PRs to
bug reports to feature requests. Your feedback is appreciated! Details of
the changes are in the CHANGELOG file. Questions or concerns can be sent
to me at jason@cypht.org, the #hastymail channel at freenode, or with an
issue filed at https://github.com/jasonmunro/cypht/.
